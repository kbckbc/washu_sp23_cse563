23 Spring semester CSE 563(Digital integrated circuit design and architecture)

## About the course
+ [Syllabus](https://github.com/kbckbc/washu_sp23_cse543/blob/main/presentation/Course-info.pdf)
+ This course is an introduction to VLSI digital design. The material will focus on bottom up design of digital integrated circuits, starting from CMOS transistor properties and manufacturing technology to CMOS inverters,  combinational and sequential logic designs and more complex digital blocks. Important design aspect of digital integrated circuits such as propagation delay, noise margins and power dissipation will be covered in the class, as well as design challenges in submicron technology will be addressed. The students will design combinational and sequential circuits at various levels of abstraction using state‐of‐the‐art CAD environment provided by Cadence Design Systems. The goal of the class is to design transistor level digital integrated circuits in 0.5micron technology that can be fabricated by a semiconductor foundry.
